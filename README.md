## [Music Game](https://github.com/emtee14/OCR-NEA/tree/master/Music-Game)
---
Noel is creating a music quiz game.
The game stores a list of song names and their artist
(e.g. the band or solo artist name). The player needs to
try and guess the song name.

## [Dice Game](https://github.com/emtee14/OCR-NEA/tree/master/Dice-Game)
---
Katarina is developing a two-player dice game.
The players roll two 6-sided dice each and get points depending on what they
roll. There are 5 rounds in a game. In each round, each player rolls the two dice.

## [Card Game]()(Coming Soon)
---
Louise is creating a card game for two players.
The game uses a deck of cards. There are 30 cards in a deck.
Each card has one colour (red, black or yellow). Each card has
a number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) for each colour. Each card
is unique.
The 30 cards are shuffled and stored in the deck.
